The last team I will talk about is the San Franicsco 49ers! For the last 7 or so years, they have been powerhouses in the NFL, they have been top 5 in the league in offense and defense. With Brock Purdy at the head of the ship, the Niners are destined for a Superbowl soon. 
They should have won against the Chiefs the last two Bowls, but the Chiefs are automically on the refs side, making it impossible to win against. Throughout last year Superbowl, no Chiefs player got called for holding, even though there is clear evidence showing otherwise.
The Niners have CMC, the best running back right now, George Kittle, the people's tight end, and Deebo Samuel, the great YAC recievers ever to play the game. the record the last 5 years is 52-31!! pretty insane!!! We will win it all this year!!
